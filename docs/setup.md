## Installation

Best option is to clone or pull the repository; avoid downloading as a zip file as it may lead to errors.

Upon opening the project, navigate to Assets -> Scenes and open the MainScene. This is the main scene of the project.

## Script editor

You can either use Microsoft Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code as the script editor. Common steps for setting up:  

1. Window -> Package Manager. In the top left corner, select "Unity Registry" from the Packages drop-down menu. Install both the "Visual Studio Code Editor" and "Visual Studio Editor" packages.

2. Edit -> Preferences -> External Tools. Set the External Script Editor to the desired editor.
